- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
